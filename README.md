# IliasQuizFetcher (2020)

This project has been my second contact with JavaScript after my seminar project in high school,
in which I developed a web-based election simulation.

The ILIAS Quiz Fetcher is a Chrome Extension, which was designed to create learning quiz forms in any 
filled out state with the push of a button and to restore the filled out backups the same way.

In a quiz on ILIAS, there is one question per view. 
The website has to be rebuilt for each additional question.
The Quiz Fetcher also has the function to navigate once through the whole quiz and to create backups on the client.
Finally, the entire quiz can automatically be filled out by with the backup file with the push of a button only.
